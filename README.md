I have kept this very simple and focused more on functionality rather than cosmetics.

Implementing the server
    - To login run server using `node index.js`
    - To authenticate use http://localhost:3000/api/auth
    - To get the api skills use postman: GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth add params token={tokenID}
Implementing the web page
    To see the web page go to http://localhost:3000/
